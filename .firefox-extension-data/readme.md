# firefox extension data

My data exports from firefox privacy extensions.

Using these settings will break some sites.
Try playing around with the settings to fix the websites.

## Chameleon

Chameleon will spoof the useragent, changing once a minute to make fingerprinting harder.

**To install:**
click the extension icon, go to the leftmost tab (`?`)

In the options tab you might have to activate the enable script injection check.

## NoScript

By default nothing will be blocked. To block scripts from a domain set it to untrusted.

**To install:**
go to `about:addons`

Open NoScript preferences and import in the top right corner
