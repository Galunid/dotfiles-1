# firefox

My [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/nightly/notes/) is configured for maximum privacy. (If you want more privacy use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org).)

It removes the history and all cookies after closure. This will cause problems, e.g. for Google CAPTCHA you will have to use a diffent browser.

After installing all privacy relevant [browser extensions](#browser-extensions) open the preferences (via menu or `about:preferences`).

### `about:preferences` under "Privacy & Security":

**Content Blocking:**

Under "Content Blocking" select Custom and check "Trackers - In all windows" and "Cookies - Third-party trackers".

**DNT:**

Set "Send websites a “Do Not Track” signal" to "Always".
