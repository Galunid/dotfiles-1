## The "From:" header line is made up by the values
## of two options - "realname" and "from":
##       From: $realname <$from>
## Please adjust the following two lines and remove the
## comment character (#) at the start of those lines:
# set from=jneidel@jneidel.com
  set from=jneidel@jneidel.com
  set realname="Jonathan Neidel"
  set use_from # tell the MTA to use this result

## Quick editing with the full header
  set autoedit      # call editor without asking for To: and Subject:
  set edit_headers  # edit mail *with* header
  set include       # cite the contents with "> "

## show the name as had been chosen
## for an alias on the sender's address
  set reverse_alias

## answer by the address as the message had been received with
## you need to tell mutt about your addresses for it to recognize.
## do this with the "alternates" command!

## repair broken subject lines to a single "Re:":
# set reply_regexp="^((aw|antw.?|antwort|re|r e|r?f|sv):[ \t]*)*"
